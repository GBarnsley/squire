The parameter table below summarises the current best estimates incorporated in `squire` as of v0.5. These will be updated when new information becomes available. 

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic reproductive number, R0 | 3.0 | [Report 13](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/) |
| Mean Incubation Period | 4.6 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/); [Linton et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.26.20018754.full.pdf); [Li et al.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316) The last 0.5 days are included in the I_MILD and I_CASE states to capture pre-symptomatic infectivity |
| Generation Time | 6.75 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/) |
| Mean Duration in I\_MILD | 2.1 days | Incorporates 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptoms; with parameters below ~95% of all infections are mild. In combination with mean duration in I\_CASE this gives a mean generation time as above |
| Mean Duration in I\_CASE | 4.5 days | Mean onset-to-admission of 4 days from UK data. Includes 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptom onset |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if survive | 9 days | Based on review of non-ICU stay, see [Hogan et al.](medrxiv) |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if die | 9 days | Based on review of non-ICU stay, see [Hogan et al.](medrxiv) |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if survive | 15.3 days | Based on [ISARIC Clinical Data Report](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) adjusted for censoring |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if die | 11.5 days | Based on [ISARIC Clinical Data Report](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) adjusted for censoring  |
| Mean duration of Stepdown post ICU (I\_Rec) | 3 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean duration of hospitalisation if require ICU but do not receive it | 1 day | Working assumption |
| Probability of dying in critical care | 50% | Based on on [ISARIC Clinical Data Report](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports), [Salje et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abc3517) and [Report 34](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-34-ifr/) |
| Probability of death if require critical care but do not receive it | 95% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
| Probability of death if require hospitalisation but do not receive it | 60% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |


### Age-Specific Parameters
